# An Investigation into Customer Churn Prediction Through Artificial Neural Networks
Customer Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, is a critical concern for businesses across industries. By leveraging ANN technology, we aim to develop accurate predictive models that can identify customers at risk of churn, enabling businesses to implement proactive retention strategies and maximize customer lifetime value.

## Features
- Utilizes multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture for ANN modeling.
- Implements comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering techniques.
- Incorporates fine-tuning and regularization methods to optimize model performance.
- Evaluates model accuracy and loss metrics to assess predictive capabilities.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone [link to github](https://github.com/sarathchandrareddy2004/customer-churn-prediction.git)
2. Install the required dependencies:
  ## Requirements

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- NumPy (version >= 1.19.5)
- Pandas (version >= 1.2.4)
- Matplotlib (version >= 3.4.2)
- Seaborn (version >= 0.11.1)
- Scikit-learn (version >= 0.24.2)
- TensorFlow (version >= 2.5.0)
- Keras (version >= 2.4.3)
3. Run the project code:
  `Naan Mudhalavan project (1).ipynb`

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing customer demographic information, purchasing behavior, and churn status. The dataset is stored in the `main` directory and can be accessed via the `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` file.

## Results
The trained ANN model achieves an accuracy of approximately 80.07% on the test dataset, with a low loss of 0.4163. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in predicting customer churn and providing actionable insights for businesses.
