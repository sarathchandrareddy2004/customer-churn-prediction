An Investigation into Customer Churn Prediction Through Artificial Neural Networks
Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, is a critical concern for businesses across industries. By leveraging ANN technology, we aim to develop accurate predictive models that can identify customers at risk of churn, enabling businesses to implement proactive retention strategies and maximize customer lifetime value.
